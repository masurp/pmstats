This package includes some custom-made functions to facilitate some
common statistical procedures as well as extracting and reporting
results from various models in RMarkdown articles. Please note that most
functions are highly costumized to my personal workflow. They may hence
break in more general frameworks or when used in a different,
non-intended wayâ€¦

## Dependencies

Most functions require the following packages:

  - For data wrangling procedures: `tidyverse` and `magrittr`
  - For printing and typesetting: `papaja`
  - For SEM procedures: `lavaan` and `semTools`

These packages should be installed prior to using this package.

## Installation

You can install the development version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("masurp/pmstats")
```
